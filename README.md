This is stockholm university webportal that is made by me using flask framework.

The goal with this portal is that it should be able to connect to other services such as wordpress and twitter via REST-API and write a post.

I have used sqlite3 as a backend database and python scripts for automating the process to write post to other services such as wordpress and twitter. 

The frontend is jquery library and a little bit of javascript.
